\begin{frame}{An Introduction to Cohen's Paper}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Scientific advancement has been hindered by null hypothesis testing (NHST)
  \item Researchers often misinterpret p-values restulting in mistakes in what can be concluded
  \item Critique the "ritualization" of NHST 
  \item Focus on real-world relevance
  \item Argues for better scientific practices

% slide 3
\begin{frame}{On Null Hypothesis Significance Testing}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Definition: Method of statistical inference by which an experimental factor is tested against a hypothesis of no effect or no relationship based on a given observation
	\begin{itemize}
	\item In other words: Null vs Alternate
	\end{itemize}
  \item p-values determine the signifiance threshold
  \item NHST dominates science
  \item If I present a significant result of a known fact like "The Earth is round," nothing is gained
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%Slide 4
\begin{frame}{A Ritualization of Reasoning $(p < .05)$}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Cohen argues against the rigid reliance on p-values
  \item Standard p-value of .05
  \item Dichotomous reject-accept decision
  \item "The primary aim of a scientific experiment is not to precipitate decisions, but to make an appropriate adjustment in the degree to which one . . . believes the hypothesis . . . being
tested" - Bill Rozeboom (1960)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 5
\begin{frame}{Misinterpretation of p-values}
\begin{itemize} %[parsep=0pt, leftmargin=4mm, topsep=0pt, itemsep=0pt]
\item Consider a Scenario
   \begin{itemize}
   \item A scientist believes a certain disease does not exist 
   \item $H_0$: P = 0
   \item He draws a random sample of 30 cases and finds that 1 person has the disease
   \item $P_S$ = 1/30 = .033
   \end{itemize}
\item Does $H_0$ need testing with a ch-square? How about a Fischer exact test??
\item Cohen among many other scientists knows that academia would complain unless this result had a p-value attached to it
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%Slide 6
\begin{frame}{So, what is wrong?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We think NHST tells us, "Given these data, what is the probability that $H_0$ is true?"
  \item What NHST actually tells us, "Given that $H_0$ is true, what is the probability of these (or more extreme) data?"
    before asking your question
  \item Academics have railed against NHST for many years before Cohen's paper
    \begin{itemize}
    \item "a potent but sterile intellectual rake who leaves in his merry path a long train of ravished maidens but no viable scientific offspring" - Meehl in 1967
    \item Joseph Berkson attacked NHST in 1938
    \item Lancelot Hogben's book-length critique appeared in 1957
    \end{itemize}
